# Responsive-Portfolio
Refined portfolio using HTML, CSS and Bootstrap

First created an index.html file as the front page. This was the file my introduction and about me is in.

Then created portfolio.html and contact.html.

In the index  file. I added a responsive navbar that spans the top of the page. This contains my name and links to my about me, portfolio and contact pages. The navbar can also be seen on those pages.

I created 1 row and 2 columns in the index.html/about me page. One contain my profile picture and the other contains my about me information. These were stylized using round-circle for the image and a button. Information can be seen in <p> tags. 

A sticky footer was also created that can be seen on all pages. 

Portfolio page was created using a button for the header with the color badge-info. The a container and rows were created. I added images with hrefs with a width and height was consistant with the other images. 

The contact used a contact box from bootstrap. Changed each text box to have a prompt for user to follow. There are 3 columns that span across using 4 sub columns each. The center column was where i place the contact box. 

This page should adjust based on screen. It is compatible with devices that are small or larger.
